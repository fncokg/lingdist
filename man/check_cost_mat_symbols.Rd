\alias{check_cost_mat_symbols}
\title{Check which symbols in `data` are missing from a cost matrix}
\usage{
check_cost_mat_symbols(cost_mat, data, delim)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost_mat}{DataFrame representing a cost matrix in square form. Row names and
column names should be the symbols included in the matrix.}

\item{data}{DataFrame containing the tokenized strings; used to extract symbols to check.}

\item{delim}{String delimiter used in `data` to split atomic symbols (empty string means
split by characters).}
}
\value{
A character vector of symbols that are present in `data` but missing from `cost_mat`.
}
\description{
Given a cost matrix (square-form DataFrame) and a data table of tokenized strings,
return a character vector of symbols that appear in `data` but are not present in the
cost matrix row/column names. This is useful to validate a user-supplied cost matrix
before running distance computations.
}
\examples{
cost.mat <- data.frame()
df <- as.data.frame(rbind(a=c("ph_l_i_z","k_o_l"), b=c("b_l_i_s","k_a:_l")))
missing <- check_cost_mat_symbols(cost.mat, df, "_")
}
