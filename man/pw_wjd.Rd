\usage{
pw_wjd(
  data,
  cate_level_weights = NULL,
  multi_form_weights = NULL,
  form_delim = "#",
  cate_delim = "_",
  squareform = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE,
  n_threads = 2L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{DataFrame with n rows and m columns indicating there are n languages or dialects to involve in the calculation and there are at most m words to base on, in which the rownames are the language ids.}

\item{cate_level_weights}{Numeric vector of weights for different levels of categories for a single word form. For example, if a word form is "A_2_a", the first weight applies to "A", the second to "2", and the third to "a". If not provided, default weights are used.}

\item{multi_form_weights}{Numeric vector of weights for different word forms of a single lexical item (ordered). For example, if a lexical item is "A_2_a#A_3#B_5_c", the first weight applies to "A_2_a", the second to "A_3", etc. If not provided, default weights are used.}

\item{form_delim}{The delimiter separating different word forms of a single lexical item. Default is "#".}

\item{cate_delim}{The delimiter separating different levels of categories within a word form. Default is "_".}

\item{squareform}{Whether to return a dataframe in squareform.}

\item{parallel}{Whether to parallelize the computation.}

\item{n_threads}{The number of threads is used to parallelize the computation. Only meaningful if `parallel` is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A dataframe in long table form if `squareform` is FALSE, otherwise in squareform.
}
\description{
Compute Weighted Jaccard Distance (WJD) between all row pairs of a dataframe. This metric is suitable for categorical data with hierarchical structure and multiple forms.
For example, a cell value "A_2_a#A_3#B_5_c" indicates there are 3 word forms for this lexical item. The first form "A_2_a" belongs to category A, subcategory 2, and sub-subcategory a. The second form "A_3" belongs to category A and subcategory 3. The third form "B_5_c" belongs to category B, subcategory 5, and sub-subcategory c. The delimiters can be customized via `form_delim` and `cate_delim`.
}
\examples{
df <- as.data.frame(rbind(a = c("A_1#B_2", "C_3"), b = c("A_1", "C_3_x")))
result <- pw_wjd(df, form_delim = "#", cate_delim = "_")
}
